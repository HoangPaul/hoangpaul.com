Team: Paul Hoang, Kenny Yu, Aashwin Gaur

We have created a web app that will allow customers to grow crops on
plots of farming land. Customers can choose a crop, fertiliser and farm
for their produce to grow. During harvest time, the customer is sent the
produce directly from the farm.

Customers are given monthly updates on how their crop is growing via the
app. Physical sensors monitors the progress of the crop and gives valuable
data to the customers.

Our solution was conceived and created in 5 days and presented at the
[Telstra Innovation Challenge](http://cto.telstra.com/TIC2017/)
