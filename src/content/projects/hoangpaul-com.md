**(November 2014 - Ongoing)**
**Solo Project**

This website provides a central location of my public work. It's also a testing bed
to learn about new tools and technologies. This website will always be changing,
thus eternally "Under Construction".

### Current Technologies

*   [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
*   [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
*   [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) by Dave Gandy
*   Based off the Hugo theme [Nix](https://github.com/LordMathis/hugo-theme-nix)

### History

*   December 2016 - Convert site to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
*   July 2016 - Static-fied website and moved to AWS S3/CloudFront
*   November 2014 - First version using CakePHP/MySQL/Apache
