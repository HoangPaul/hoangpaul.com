## Spotless Hack @ the G <small>Finalist</small>

Team: David Lei, Erfan Norozi, Kenny Yu, Patrick Shaw, Paul Hoang, Ramzi Hossari

We have created an IoT device that uses ultrasonic waves to determine a bin's capacity and
transmits this information to a centralised server for data analysis and visualisation.

Using an Android application, cleaners have real-time information to identify
bins nearing capacity so that they can attend to them before they overflow.

Managers can identify problem areas through visualisation tools via a web application.
This information can also help plan for future infrastructure projects.

Our solution was created and presented at [Spotless Hack @ the G](https://spotless-hack-the-g.devpost.com/)
and was awarded a position as a [finalist](https://devpost.com/software/intellibins).
