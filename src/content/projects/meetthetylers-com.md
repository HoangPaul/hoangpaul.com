A static site for my sister's wedding.

## Static Site Generator

As part of this project, I had written a static site generator in Node.js
to make content changes easier. The static site generator had the following features:

* Web-based WYSIWYG editor with image manipulation.
* Ability to preview the changes before deployment.
* Ability to deploy to live with one click.
* Ability to specify RSVP form target email address.
