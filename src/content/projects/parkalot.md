Team: Paul Hoang, Kenny Yu, Keith Lee, Kevin Vu

We have created a web app that will allow users to find parking near their
destination. The user enters their destination, and the app will direct
them to the nearest available parking spot.

The app uses the data provided by the
[City of Melbourne Parking Survey](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/dataset/Parking-Survey/fj3w-qu3z/data),
which has data for both free and paid public parking spots.

Our solution was created in 48 hours and presented at [AngelHack Melbourne 2017](http://angelhack.com/portfolio-item/angelhack-global-hackathon-series-melbourne-may-6-7-2017/)
