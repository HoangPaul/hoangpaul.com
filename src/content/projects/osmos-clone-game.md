**(August 2014 - October 2014)**  
**Solo Project**

A student project for Real Time Rendering, Semester 2 2014.  
A computer game inspired by [Osmos](http://www.osmos-game.com/). The goal
is to become the largest mote by absorbing smaller motes. Be careful, as other larger motes can absorb you!

### Functionality and features

*   Spatial partitioning collision detection which allows thousands of motes while maintaining an acceptable
    framerate.
*   Custom shader programs, which utilises transparency and pseudo-random colours.
*   AI controlled enemy.
*   Two different arenas (square or circular).
*   SDL for window and event management.
